# 6. User Input for the Quiz

Now that we've fetched the quiz questions, we need to display the possible answers and let the user select one.

## Displaying the answers


We create a `Section` for each quiz question and use `ForEach` to iterate over its possible answers.

Inside each section, we display each answer as a `Text` row. Later, we can update these rows to be tappable and reflect the user's selection.

Finally, we can add `.listStyle(.grouped)` to the list to give a cleaner appearance.


```swift
List {
    // 1. for each question, create a section. 
    ForEach(self.questions) { question in
        Section {
            // 2. for each question answer, create a row.
            ForEach(question.answers, id: \.self) { answer in
                Text(answer)
            }
        } header: {
            Text(question.question)
                .textCase(.none)
        }
    }
}
```

## Handling User Input

To keep track of the user's selections, we'll store the answers in a dictionary where:
- The **key** is the question ID
- The **value** is the selected answer

This structure makes it easy to update and access each user's choice as they progress through the quiz.

```swift
@State var answers: [Trivia.Question.ID: String] = [:]

//  Example:
//
//  answers = [
//    "What's the capital of Oklahoma?": "Oklahoma City"
//    "What's the official bird of North Carolina?": "Cardinal"
//  ]
```

Next, weâ€™ll add a button around each answer to let the user select it. When tapped, the button will update our answers dictionary with the selected value.

We can also display a checkmark image next to the selected answer to give clear visual feedback. Additionally, we can change the color of the button based on whether or not itâ€™s selected, making the UI more intuitive and interactive.

```swift
ForEach(question.answers, id: \.self) { answer in
    Button {
        self.answers[question.id] = answer
    } label: {
        HStack {
            Text(answer)
            Spacer()
            if self.answers[question.id] == answer {
                Image(systemName: "checkmark")
            }
        }
    }
    .foregroundColor(
        self.answers[question.id] == answer
        ? .accentColor
        : .primary
    )
}
```

## Improving Code Readability

Finally, we can extract the answer row into a separate view or function to make the code easier to read and maintain. This helps keep the `List` body clean and improves reusability.

```swift
ForEach(question.answers, id: \.self) { answer in
    self.answerView(question, answer)
}
```
```swift
private func answerView(
    _ question: Trivia.Question,
    _ answer: String
) -> some View {
    
    // Declarative Code
    let isSelected = self.answers[question.id] == answer
    
    return Button {
        self.answers[question.id] = answer
    } label: {
        HStack {
            Text(answer)
            Spacer()
            if isSelected {
                Image(systemName: "checkmark")
            }
        }
    }
    .foregroundColor(isSelected ? .accentColor : .primary)
}
```

### ðŸŽ‰ Finished!

In the next section, we will start building the results page.
