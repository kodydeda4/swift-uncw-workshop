## Overview

Today we’re creating a trivia app for iOS, powered by [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com). We’ll fetch trivia data in JSON format and use it to build our app.

This workshop is going to use the following tools:

* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) - Apple's declarative UI Framework  
* [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com) - a free, community-contributed collection of trivia questions.  
* [swift-opentdb](https://github.com/kodydeda4/swift-opentdb) Unofficial OpenTriviaDatabase package for swift
