### What We're Building

We're building a trivia app for iOS using [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com). The app will fetch trivia questions in JSON format and present them in a fun, interactive quiz experience.

Key technologies and resources:

> * [**SwiftUI**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) – Apple’s modern, declarative UI framework for building iOS apps  
> * [**Open Trivia Database**](https://opentdb.com) – A free, community-driven API with thousands of trivia questions  
> * [**swift-opentdb**](https://github.com/kodydeda4/swift-opentdb) – An unofficial Swift package for fetching and decoding Open Trivia DB questions
